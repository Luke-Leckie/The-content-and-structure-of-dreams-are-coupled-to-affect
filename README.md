Code and data for publication entitled "The-content-and-structure-of-dreams-are-coupled-to-affect".
Pt1. is for creating topic networks, to quantify repot semantic structure, after performing Discourse Atom Topic Modeling: https://github.com/arsena-k/discourse_atoms/tree/master
Here, we use it on the DreamBank dataset: https://dreambank.net/
Pt1. also assigns valence/arousal to topics and whole reports. It further includes plots and statistics that we use in the paper. 
Pt2. is for performing Partial Least Squares Regression, with permutation testing, on the extracted network properties.
'explore_dream_networks.ipynb' is a true accompaniment to our paper. It allows you to sample dreams from the corpus, visualise their networks and see where their affect and networks properties are ranked.
We also include our embedding and tested topic models alongside all of our final data, as contained in the .zip files.
